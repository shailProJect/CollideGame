# Super Max Game

**Super Max** is a simple web-based game where you control a character and avoid insects falling from the top of the screen. Use the arrow keys to move and jump, and aim to avoid collisions with the insects to achieve a high score.

## Features

-   **Character Movement**: Move left and right using arrow keys.
-   **Jumping**: Jump using the up arrow key.
-   **Insects**: Multiple insects fall from the top, increasing in speed upon collision.
-   **Collision Counter**: Keeps track of the number of collisions.
-   **Timer**: The game runs for 1 minute and ends when the timer reaches zero.
-   **Game Over**: Alerts when the game ends and shows the total number of collisions.

## Usage

-   **Jump**: Press the **Up Arrow** key.
-   **Avoid Insects**: Try to avoid collisions with the insects falling from the top of the screen.

## Game Mechanics

-   **Character**: The character moves within the game container and can jump to avoid insects.
-   **Insects**: Insects fall from the top and reset to the top after moving out of the visible area. Collisions with insects increase the collision count and speed up the character.
-   **Timer**: The game duration is set to 1 minute. The game ends when the timer runs out.
